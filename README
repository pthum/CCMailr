Category: Java II
===========================================================

CCMailr is an application for generating temporary mailaccounts like the 
services mailinator.com or spamgourmet.com

The application is based on the Play2.0 Framework. It connects to a
Apache James 3.0beta4 Server and provides User-Management and Mailbox-Management.


Frameworks/Librarys/Code/etc which were provided by others:
- JBCrypt - a Java BCrypt implementation

-------------
Installation:
-------------
- Install Play 2.0 
- Install H2 Database
- Install and Configure the Apache James Mailserver
- Configure the App

- since there is no real HTTPS support in play 2.0 until now
  you have to install and configure a reverse proxy as described in
  http://www.playframework.org/documentation/2.0.1/HTTPServer
  A nice guide to set up the reverse proxy correctly is described in
  http://www.nczonline.net/blog/2012/08/08/setting-up-apache-as-a-ssl-front-end-for-play/
  and a german tutorial for generating the server.key file and self-signed certificate server.crt
  is available at http://www.schirmacher.de/display/INFO/Apache+SSL+Zertifikat+erstellen
  


--------------
Configuration:
--------------
- if you build the project yourself from sources, change the app key  in /conf/application.conf 
  by running 'play secret'
  
- configure your Database Server in the Database configuration section
- set your preferred values in the Mailbox configuration section and the 
  address of the James Server 
- set the values for the admin account which will be created during first start

Known Issue:
- As mentioned in http://james.apache.org/server/3/install.html
  Apache James Server 3.0beta4 won't start with JDK 7 (due to a Bug in JAXB)
  Fix:
  	- Download: http://jaxb.java.net/2.1.13/JAXB2_20100510.jar
  	- Copy it into the conf/lib of James
  	- Rename it to jaxb-impl.jar
  	- You should then be able to start James
